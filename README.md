# EduMentor: AI-Driven Tutoring with Advanced Technology and Data Privacy

**Description:**
EduMentor harnesses OpenAI's Assistant API and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver a cutting-edge educational platform. The integration of these technologies facilitates a dynamic and responsive learning experience, tailored to individual educational needs.

**Mechanism of EduMentor:**
- **OpenAI Assistant API**: EduMentor leverages this robust API for its core AI functionalities. The API enables the AI to interpret complex code, retrieve relevant information efficiently, and perform specific functions, thereby enriching the learning experience. More about the Assistant API can be found [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/assistants).
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This framework enhances the AI's responses by grounding them in external, up-to-date sources. It combines retrieval models with generative models, ensuring contextually accurate and information-rich responses.
